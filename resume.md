## Summary
I'm a Technical Lead with almost 7 years of hands-on experience building enterprise web platforms that actually matter. I love transforming complex business problems into elegant technical solutions - whether that's migrating legacy monoliths to modern microservices or optimizing database queries from 20-minute nightmares to 30-second victories. My sweet spot is Laravel and Vue.js, but I'm equally comfortable diving into React, Node.js, or whatever technology gets the job done. I've led teams through challenging architectural decisions, mentored developers, and delivered systems that serve millions of records daily. When I'm not coding, I'm writing detailed case studies about the technical challenges I've solved - because great engineering deserves to be shared.
