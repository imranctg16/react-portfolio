    subtitle: 'Production-Grade Digital Workflow Automation System',
    description:
      "An enterprise workflow automation system I've been architecting for Grameenphone over the past 2 years. What started as a legacy CakePHP application has evolved into a robust microservices platform with 11 independent services, automating all workflows across the organization and winning multiple internal awards for efficiency improvements.",
    motivation:
      "As a solution architect, I led the transformation of a monolithic CakePHP application into a modern microservices architecture. The challenge was to modernize legacy systems while maintaining business continuity for one of Bangladesh's largest telecom operators. This project has automated critical workflows and significantly improved operational efficiency.",
